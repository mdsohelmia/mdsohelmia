# 👋 Hey there! I’m Sohel Mia

I’m a backend and infrastructure engineer who took the leap into entrepreneurship. Now, as the **Co-founder & CTO at [Tenbyte](https://tenbyte.com.my)**, I’m on a mission to build **global video and cloud infrastructure** that helps businesses deliver content faster, safer, and more reliably — no matter where their users are.

### 👨‍💻 A Bit About Me

- I’m passionate about building scalable **CDNs and video platforms** that just work.
- I love designing **distributed systems** and **microservices** that can grow effortlessly.
- My work focuses a lot on **video encoding, transcoding, DRM, and security** — making sure video content is smooth and secure.
- Over the years, I’ve built production software that solves real problems (8+ years and counting!).
- I’m a big believer in writing clean, maintainable code using **SOLID principles** and simple, elegant architecture.
- When I’m not coding or architecting systems, I’m often exploring open source projects and hacking on infrastructure tools.
